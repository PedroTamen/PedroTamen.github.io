    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Pool Game</h3>
    <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020).
 In this project I have used arrays, loops and classes in order to create a functioning pool game.
 In this project I created two classes, Holes and Balls which are created and displayed on screen where they can interact with each other.
 Firstly a pointer is drawn originating from the cue ball and when clicked a sound is played and the ball is launched at a speed dependant on the length of the line.
 Then using a nested loop an array of Balls the position vectors are all compared with each other to see if they have collided and if so respond accordingly, collisions with any Holes and edges are also checked to see whether any Balls should bounce or be removed.
 Finally a win message is displayed once all balls have been removed displaying the number of turns used.</p>
